// ******************************************

        // What's the difference between window.load and DOMContentLoaded?
        
        // The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the document has been completely loaded and parsed, 
        // without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

        // Load event is fired when all the images and subframes finished loading.

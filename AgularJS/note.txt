        // without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

        // Load event is fired when all the images and subframes finished loading.

AngularJS > [()] is used to do 2 way binding in Angular

babel:JS compiler
class in html -> compiler -> load into DOM -> CLASS 变 Object

watcher:
how many watchers? depends on how many data bindings。
机器自动安排了watcher给某些变量，但是我们还是可以自己再设置watcher去观察这些变量。

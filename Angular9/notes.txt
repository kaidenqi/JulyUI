logout com
user service

ng g c pending --module todo

cd ./src/app/todo
ng g c done


create a component: ng g c task

Property Binding:
Attribute and value are not the same
Attribute - HTML
Property - DOM

Attributes are used to inintialize the DOM Properties 
Attribute are immutable
Properties can be changed


Interpolation is great for string values
to bind other data types like boolean we need property Binding


Class Binding: CSS classes
class=""  [class]=""

Any one not both

() are used for event binding

template refrence variable

Angular Material

ngSwitch

ngFor

pipes

custom pipes

services

DRY
SRP

HTTP Calls

Service:
Component in angular is resposible for the UI, not for 
fetching data. So we need service to fetch data.
